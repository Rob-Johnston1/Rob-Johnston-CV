    <h1>Rob Johnston - Delivery Manager</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I currently work at EY as a Delivery Manager. I am passionate about using Agile methodologies and am experienced in Scrum and Kanban.</p>
    <p>I began my career as a Business Analyst for a commodities trading platform. I was commended for my relationship management with clients and my initiative to improve internal processes.</p>
    <!--I am a comment-->
    <p>I studied Biomedical Sciences, specialising in Neuroscience at The University of Edinburgh. I then pursued a masters degree in Cognitive and Decision Sciences at UCL. 
      Both my undergraduate and masters degrees have given me a deep understanding of human behaviour which has given me a people-focused approach to software development.</p>
